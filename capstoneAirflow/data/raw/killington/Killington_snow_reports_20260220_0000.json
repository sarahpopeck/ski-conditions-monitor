    "report": "<p>Good evening, Killington,</p><p>It was another unreal day here at The Beast, with bright, clear skies setting the stage for buttery turns across the mountain. And we\u2019ve got even more good news on the way. Snow moves in tomorrow afternoon, with flakes picking up after 2 p.m. under breezy east winds and temps topping out around 26 degrees at the summit and 29 degrees at the base. We\u2019re tracking 8 to 12 inches of fresh snow between Friday afternoon and Saturday night. Fresh turns are definitely on the menu!</p><p>We're still 100% open and are serving up the most expansive playground in the East. From top-to-bottom groomers to bump lines and hidden tree shots, it\u2019s all in play. Snow surfaces were gripping beautifully again today, letting you link one deep turn after another as the sun and warmer temps kept the slopes soft, smooth, and playful. Groomed trails provide confidence inducing turns and are a blast to lean the edges into. Even as the day goes on, the smooth runs that turn into soft packed and packed powder continue to have a fun surface to rip on.&nbsp;</p><p>Our groomers are after the same program except they\u2019ll be leaving Ovation on natural. Downdraft will see a resurface again and Superstar is still skiing &amp; riding really well. Make your way over to Needle\u2019s Eye on Cruise Control for a classic, cruise worthy run that never disappoints. For our full list of groomers, check out the <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire up later this week. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad and Canyon Quad opening soon after at 10:00 a.m. The Bear Mountain Quad will also spin again, offering full access to Outer Limits and Devil\u2019s Fiddle, amongst other favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\">kparks</a>, the lineup stays stacked. Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, and The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods. On Ramshead, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, 5 jumps, and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed in for fun progression options.</p><p>Tomorrow, February 20th, we'll be hosting <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/events/events-calendar/200k-shred-day/\">200K Shred Day</a> to celebrate Killington hitting 200,000 followers on Instagram!

    "report": "<p>Happy 100th day, Beast fans!</p><p>The conditions were absolutely beautiful yesterday, with soft snow that made it easy to dig your edges in and sunshine that added to the fun. We\u2019ll have more of those great surfaces waiting for you today, with 100% of our trails open and the most terrain offered in the East. We're also under a storm watch with 5 to 9 inches of new snow possible staring in the early afternoon tomorrow through Saturday.</p><p>Mostly sunny skies are on tap, with a high near 29\u00b0 at the base and 24\u00b0 at the peak. Light winds out of the northeast will shift southwest in the afternoon, keeping things comfortable as you chase the sun across The Beast.</p><p>Pretty much everything was fun to shred yesterday as the recent warmer temps softened up the snow and made for ideal surfaces to turn and slide on. Rime was the spot for silky smooth corduroy and everything at Bear Mountain has been shredding fantastically.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team worked through the night resurfacing over 80 trails. They threw Lower Downdraft and Middle Ovation on the plan which are both perfect runs for those chasing an adrenaline rush of carving. Superstar also has fresh corduroy and has been fun to ride. Head over to Bunny Buster for something more mellow that still has prime surfaces for arcing in the morning. Groomed surfaces will turn to equally enjoyable soft pack and packed powder as the day goes on.

    "report": "<p>Good evening, Beast fans, &nbsp;</p><p>The conditions were absolutely beautiful today, with soft snow that made it easy to dig your edges in and sunshine that added to the fun. We\u2019ll have more of those great surfaces waiting for you tomorrow, with 100% of our trails open and the most terrain offered in the East!</p><p>Mostly sunny skies are on tap tomorrow, with a high near 29\u00b0 at the base and 24\u00b0 at the peak. Light winds out of the northeast will shift southwest in the afternoon, keeping things comfortable as you chase the sun across The Beast.</p><p>Pretty much everything was fun to shred today as the recent warmer temps softened up the snow and made for ideal surfaces to turn and slide on. Rime was the spot for silky smooth corduroy and everything at Bear Mountain has been shredding fantastically.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team will be working through the night resurfacing over 80 trails. They threw Lower Downdraft and Middle Ovation on the plan which are both perfect runs for those chasing an adrenaline rush of carving. Superstar is also going to have fresh corduroy tomorrow and has been fun to ride. Head over to Bunny Buster for something more mellow that still has prime surfaces for arcing in the morning. Groomed surfaces will turn to equally enjoyable spring-like surfaces later in the day, and there\u2019s plenty of packed powder around the mountain. For our full list of groomers, check out the <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire back up later on this week. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad and Canyon Quad opening soon after at 10:00 a.m. The Bear Mountain Quad will also spin again, offering full access to Outer Limits and Devil\u2019s Fiddle, amongst other black diamond favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\">kparks</a>, the lineup stays stacked. Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, and The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods. On Ramshead, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, 5 jumps, and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed in for fun progression options.</p><p>On Friday, February 20th, we'll be hosting a <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/events/events-calendar/200k-shred-day/\">200K Shred Day</a> to celebrate Killington hitting 200,000 followers on Instagram! Join us for our all-day party, first featuring a scavenger hunt for 20 YETI mugs hidden around the mountain. Find one to keep, and you\u2019ll score a 1-day lift ticket voucher placed inside, valid through June 1, 2027. We'll also be leading a party lap from the top of Superstar at 2:20 p.m., immediately followed by an apr\u00e8s scene at the bottom of Superstar featuring DJ Stevie B, $2.20 Michelob ULTRA drafts, plus complimentary NA beverages and giveaways.</p><p>Finally, our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\">Tubing Park presented by bubly</a> remains open daily this week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.&nbsp;</p><p>Our one-hundredth day of shredding and more fun scenes await!&nbsp;</p><p>\u2013 Evan</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Operating Day: 100&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><u>Lifts</u></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Key lifts operate seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, and from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday plus Peak Dates*; the Bear Mountain Quad will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every Saturday through the end of March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The North Ridge Quad will open at 9:30 a.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. on weekends, the Canyon Quad will spin from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekends, and the Sunrise Village Triple will spin until 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and 4:00 p.m. on weekends.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><em>A note for our snowboarders:</em> Thanks to our new cabins on the Skyeship Gondola, we're asking you to please utilize the snowboard racks outside of each cabin.

    "report": "<p lang=\"EN-US\">Good morning, Beast fans!&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">It\u2019s felt downright balmy compared to recent memory, with temps creeping all the way up to 33\u00b0 yesterday. That just meant soft snow, gentle turns, and some nice, easy midweek laps. We\u2019re still offering up the most terrain in the East, so there are plenty of fun options to choose from today.</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Temps will stay in the mid 20s throughout the day, with winds staying calm throughout the morning and gusts at the peak only topping out around 25mph once the afternoon rolls around. There\u2019s also a chance at some more snow showers towards the tail of the day, with 1-3\" of accumulation possible.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">A highlight recently has been Upper Home Stretch, which offers a fun alternate route down to Skyeship base if you&nbsp;feel like straying from the safe confines of Great Eastern. Surfaces today won\u2019t be quite as soft as they were by the end of yesterday, so it should feel a bit more like winter than spring on the slopes. Areas at higher elevation that softened up may have a small crust in the morning, but temps aren\u2019t due to get low enough to seriously freeze anything up. Our groomers continued to do their thing last night, so if you\u2019re feeling hesitant about natural surfaces, check out our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\"><u>Lifts &amp; Trails Report</u></a> for the full list of groomed trails.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Speaking of, our grooming plan is offering many of the usual hits, with some extra attention being paid to smoothing out the entrances &amp; exits to adjacent trails along Superstar. We got winch cats out on Lower Pipe Dream to offer a groomed route to the South Ridge Quad, as well as on Lower Great Bear, which has tons of coverage after seeing a good amount of snowmaking.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire back up later on this week. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\"><u>Insider Blog</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad and Canyon Quad opening soon after at 10:00 a.m. The Bear Mountain Quad will also spin again, offering full access to Outer Limits and Devil\u2019s Fiddle, amongst other black diamond favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\"><u>kparks</u></a>, the lineup stays stacked. Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, and The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods. On Ramshead, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, 5 jumps, and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed in for fun progression options.</p><p>On Friday, February 20th, we'll be hosting a <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/events/events-calendar/200k-shred-day/\">200K Shred Day</a> to celebrate Killington hitting 200,000 followers on Instagram! Join us for our all-day party, first featuring a scavenger hunt for 20 YETI mugs hidden around the mountain. Find one to keep, and you\u2019ll score a 1-day lift ticket voucher placed inside, valid through June 1, 2027. We'll also be leading a party lap from the top of Superstar at 2:20 p.m., immediately followed by an apr\u00e8s scene at the bottom of Superstar featuring a live DJ, $2.20 Michelob ULTRA drafts, plus complimentary NA beverages and giveaways.</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Finally, our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\"><u>Tubing Park presented by bubly</u></a> remains open daily this week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">More good times again today?

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Beast fans!</p><p>It was a great end to the long weekend yesterday, and it looks like it's going to be another great day out there today. Comfortable temps, just a soft breeze, great visibility, and wall-to-wall terrain made for a fantastic President\u2019s Day on snow. We\u2019re rolling right through the holiday week with prime midwinter conditions across the most open terrain in the East.</p><p>Weather-wise, today will bring mostly cloudy skies with highs in the mid to upper 20s up top and low 30s at the base. Winds will be on the lighter side, generally 10\u201315 mph out of the west. There\u2019s a chance for light, showery precipitation during the day, mainly snow, with a brief mix possible at lower elevations. Nothing impactful, and the slightly warmer temps should help surfaces soften up nicely through the afternoon.</p><p>Snow surfaces remain in a really good place. Groomed terrain continues to offer that smooth, carve-friendly packed powder feel, with a few isolated slick spots here and there. With moderating temps, expect a little more give under your edges today while still holding onto that classic Beast bite.</p><p>Our grooming team is going with their usual plan, laying down cord across 89 trails, including Header, Wildfire, and Easy Street to name a few. Lower Double Dipper, Downdraft, and Lower Pipe Dream will come off the grooming plan, so those areas may start to bump up for anyone looking to mix in some natural terrain. Superstar has been added to the grooming lineup as crews begin flattening out the snowmaking whales while continuing to build toward spring. If you're looking to plan out your day, check out our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a> for all the latest.</p><p>Snowmaking operations are currently on hold with the warmer temperatures. If colder weather returns later this week, we could see guns fire back up. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin once again today at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad opening at 10:00 a.m. In addition to our regular Tuesday lineup, lifts like the Bear Mountain Quad, South Ridge Quad, and Canyon Quad will be running today, giving you even more terrain to explore.</p><p>Looking ahead, there are multiple additional chances for snow later this week and into the weekend, enough to keep things fresh as we move deeper into February.</p><p>Our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\">Tubing Park presented by bubly</a> remains open daily this week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p><p>Over in kparks, the lineup stays stacked. Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus natural hits in the woods, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed on Ramshead.</p><p>Gonna feel a bit more like spring today.

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Beast fans!</p><p>It was a great end to the long weekend yesterday, and it looks like it's going to be another great day out there today. Comfortable temps, just a soft breeze, great visibility, and wall-to-wall terrain made for a fantastic President\u2019s Day on snow. We\u2019re rolling right through the holiday week with prime midwinter conditions across the most open terrain in the East.</p><p>Weather-wise, today will bring mostly cloudy skies with highs in the mid to upper 20s up top and low 30s at the base. Winds will be on the lighter side, generally 10\u201315 mph out of the west. There\u2019s a chance for light, showery precipitation during the day, mainly snow, with a brief mix possible at lower elevations. Nothing impactful, and the slightly warmer temps should help surfaces soften up nicely through the afternoon.</p><p>Snow surfaces remain in a really good place. Groomed terrain continues to offer that smooth, carve-friendly packed powder feel, with a few isolated slick spots here and there. With moderating temps, expect a little more give under your edges today while still holding onto that classic Beast bite.</p><p>Our grooming team is going with their usual plan, laying down cord across 89 trails, including Header, Wildfire, and Easy Street to name a few. Lower Double Dipper, Downdraft, and Lower Pipe Dream will come off the grooming plan, so those areas may start to bump up for anyone looking to mix in some natural terrain. Superstar has been added to the grooming lineup as crews begin flattening out the snowmaking whales while continuing to build toward spring. Just a reminder, Launch Pad (as it crosses Superstar) will be for advanced skiers and riders only again tomorrow due to snowmaking mounds on Superstar. If you're looking to plan your day tomorrow, check out our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a> for all the latest.</p><p>Snowmaking operations are currently on hold with the warmer temperatures. If colder weather returns later this week, we could see guns fire back up. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin once again today at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad opening at 10:00 a.m. In addition to our regular Tuesday lineup, lifts like the Bear Mountain Quad, South Ridge Quad, and Canyon Quad will be running today, giving you even more terrain to explore.</p><p>Looking ahead, there are multiple additional chances for snow later this week and into the weekend, enough to keep things fresh as we move deeper into February.</p><p>Our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\">Tubing Park presented by bubly</a> remains open daily this week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p><p>Over in kparks, the lineup stays stacked.

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Beast fans,</p><p>We\u2019re rolling into President\u2019s Day with prime midwinter conditions across the most open terrain in the East. A flurry or two is possible early this morning, but clouds will decrease through the day with some sun breaking out this afternoon.</p><p>Temperatures will feel comfortable for this time of year, especially compared to the deep cold we saw earlier this month. Look for highs in the mid-20s up top and upper-20s at the base, with a light south breeze around 10\u201315 mph. It\u2019s classic Vermont winter, crisp, manageable, and ideal for long laps.</p><p>Snow surfaces remain in a really good place. Groomed terrain is delivering that smooth, carve-friendly packed powder feel by the afternoon, with a few isolated slick spots here and there. Expect fresh machine-groomed corduroy this morning, with the potential for a little softening this afternoon as temps moderate and the sun works through.</p><p>Our grooming team is sticking with the same plan as last night, minus Outer Limits, which will ski on natural snow today (enjoy those bumps!). With 100% of trails open, you\u2019ve got options everywhere, from money turns on Bunny Buster and Double Dipper to steeper lines across Skye Peak. To help plan your day, check out our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a> for all the latest.</p><p>Holiday lift hours are in effect. All lifts will be running today with key lifts starting to spin at 8:00 a.m. Head over to South Ridge for a sweet morning cruise down Pipe Dream, prime for lapping when the South Ridge Quad starts spinning at 9:00 a.m.</p><p>Snowmaking continues around the K-1 base area and lower Superstar, with spot guns in the middle of Snowdon. Most of Devil\u2019s Fiddle is coming offline, though the bottom section will continue to receive attention. Surfaces near active snowmaking may be variable, so please stay alert in those zones.</p><p>A quick reminder: the whales on Superstar are building, and skiing &amp; riding across Launch Pad on Superstar is currently for expert guests only. If you\u2019re looking for a smoother route down, follow the Peak to Creek emblems and stay on Bear Trax.</p><p>If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.</p><p>Looking ahead, we may see a light refresh of a couple of inches over the next few days, just enough to keep things interesting. Think snow!</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\">Tubing Park presented by bubly</a> is open from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. today, offering another great way to keep the holiday fun going.</p><p>Over in kparks, the lineup remains stacked. Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, The Stash is fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus natural hits in the woods, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features and a halfpipe, Easy Street Progression Park has 10 features, and Lil\u2019 Stash and Vale Yard remain dialed.</p><p>Another strong winter day at The Beast. Enjoy the sun and comfortable temps, and we\u2019ll see you out there!</p><p>-Josh</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Operating Day: 97</strong></p><p><strong><u>Lifts</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Key lifts operate seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, and from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday plus Peak Dates*; the Bear Mountain Quad will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every Saturday through the end of March.&nbsp;</p><p>The North Ridge Quad will open at 9:30 a.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. on weekends, the Canyon Quad will spin from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekends, and the Sunrise Village Triple will spin until 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and 4:00 p.m. on weekends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>A note for our snowboarders:</em> Thanks to our new cabins on the Skyeship Gondola, we're asking you to please utilize the snowboard racks outside of each cabin.

Temps will top out near 30\u00b0 at the base and 23\u00b0 near the top, with a steady south wind around 10\u201315 mph. It\u2019s classic Vermont conditions so get after it.</p><p>Despite the beautiful sun beating down on the mountain and perfect temps keeping us happy, the quality of our snow surfaces has not taken a hit at all. Devils Fiddle has been on point and I\u2019ve heard some say it was their run of the year so far. Now that\u2019s some seriously good shredding. You obviously can't go wrong with the terrain at Bear Mountain, and Skyeburst is a great run to cruise on just nearby. All of our lifts will be running tomorrow with key lifts starting to spin at 8:00 a.m. Head over to South Ridge for a sweet morning cruise down Pipe Dream, prime for lapping when the South Ridge Quad starts spinning at 9:00 a.m.</p><p>Our grooming team is after it again, covering 96 trials with flush corduroy. They\u2019ll be tackling the same plan minus Outer Limits which will be skiing on natural tomorrow. Groomers are still skiing incredibly well so pick your choice from the <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a> and have a blast carving it up. Some of my favorite picks are Bunny Buster and Double Dipper for those money turns.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking crews will be lighting up snowguns around the K-1 base area and lower Superstar, with spot guns on the middle of Snowdon. Most of Devils Fiddle will be coming offline besides the bottom section which will get some more attention after temps required a break. The snow can be variable near snowmaking so please take note of that when skiing &amp; riding near those areas. If you are curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A quick note related to snowmaking: the whales on Superstar are getting quite large, and skiing &amp; riding on Launch Pad across Superstar is currently for expert skiers and riders only. If you want an easier cruising route, follow our Peak to Creek emblems on our trail signs and stay on Bear Trax.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in kparks, the lineup remains stacked. Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, The Stash remains fully in play with wooden and stone features plus natural hits in the woods, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, five jumps, and a halfpipe, Easy Street Progression Park has 10 features, and Lil\u2019 Stash is open with three jumps, a tree jump, and a wall ride. In our Vale Yard Park, we're still rocking the Park Affair build from last weekend, featuring 9 features and jumps in total from XS to M difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\">Tubing Park presented by bubly</a> will open at 10:00 a.m. and will run until 6:00 p.m. this week, offering another great way to keep the fun going off the slopes.</p><p>We\u2019re still rolllin\u2019 and I\u2019ll see you out there!</p><p>\u2013 Evan</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Operating Day: 97</strong></p><p><em>Upcoming blackout dates for Ikon Base and Ikon Session Passes are as follows: Feb 14-15, 2026.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Lifts</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Key lifts operate seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, and from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday plus Peak Dates*; the Bear Mountain Quad will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every Saturday through the end of March.&nbsp;</p><p>The North Ridge Quad will open at 9:30 a.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. on weekends, the Canyon Quad will spin from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekends, and the Sunrise Village Triple will spin until 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and 4:00 p.m. on weekends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>A note for our snowboarders:</em> Thanks to our new cabins on the Skyeship Gondola, we're asking you to please utilize the snowboard racks outside of each cabin. If the racks are entirely full, please put your boards underneath the seats. This differs from our K-1 Gondola, where all snowboards should be brought inside the cabins.
