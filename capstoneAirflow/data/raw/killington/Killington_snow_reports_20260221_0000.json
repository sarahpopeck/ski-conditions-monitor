    "report": "<p>Happy Friday, Beast fans!&nbsp;</p><p>Today started off with great visibility and ended up a blizzard, with plenty more snow falling as of this writing. We\u2019re looking at another potential 4-8\" overnight plus another 1-2\" tomorrow morning, on top of the 3\u201d that fell before lifts stopped spinning today. All signs are pointing towards a day for the ages tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">If you want to be the first to the powder in the morning, we have great news for you: the Bear Mountain Quad is scheduled to start spinning at 7:30 a.m. tomorrow. The rest of our key lifts are due to spin starting at 8:00 a.m., with the exception of Canyon Quad, South Ridge Quad, and the Snowdon Triple starting at 9:00 a.m. and the Snowshed Double starting at 10:00 a.m.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Tomorrow\u2019s weather looks like we\u2019re in for another comfy day, with base temps hovering in the mid 20s all day. Winds will be very gentle at the bottoms of lifts and won\u2019t gust higher than around 25mph at the peak. Seems like the bulk of the snow from this storm will fall before the morning, but please be cautious when commuting up to the mountain tomorrow. Our parking attendants will be out in force to make sure we can use our lots as efficiently as possible.</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">As for the snow conditions, not much more to say besides that we\u2019re in for a heck of a powder day. Before the snow came down today, groomed runs were running ultra smooth, with a couple highlights being Lower Pipe Dream and Lower Wildfire. Tomorrow, truly everything will be in play, as we\u2019re still boasting 100% of our open terrain. Powder day classics like Helter Skelter will get plenty of love tomorrow, while glade runs like Twister and Roundabout Glade are sure to be a blast.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">On the grooming front, our crew will be tackling an audacious 89 trails this evening, with many of the usuals making the cut plus a few additions. Solitude and Sassafras will get a grooming pass, so making first tracks on those winding trails will be a bit easier. All of Low Road will be smoothed out, giving an extra groomed option into Snowshed from Skye Peak. Frolic, Home Stretch, Pipe Dream, and many more will also be nice and smooth in the morning\u2014check our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Lifts &amp; Trails Report</u></a> for the whole list.</p><p>As if this storm wasn\u2019t bringing enough snow, we\u2019re back to making our own. That\u2019s right: we\u2019ll be turning the snowguns on tomorrow afternoon on Superstar, Skyelark, Bittersweet, High Road, and additional connecting trails around the mountain. This snowmaking run should last all the way through Wednesday, bringing even more cover to trails we hope to see skiing well into the spring.&nbsp;</p><p>Shout out to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>kparks</u></a> team, a few of whom are up in Burlington tonight to build &amp; maintain the course for this year\u2019s Burton Winter Jam. In the meantime, the lineup in our own Killington Parks stays stacked. Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, including a sweet rail section near the base of Bear Mountain, while The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods. On Ramshead, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, 5 jumps, and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed in for fun progression options.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Rest your legs for tomorrow and enjoy the pow!</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">- Cullen&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Operating Day: 102</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Lifts</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Key lifts operate seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, and from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday plus Peak Dates*; the Bear Mountain Quad will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every Saturday through the end of March.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The North Ridge Quad will open at 9:30 a.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. on weekends, the Canyon Quad will spin from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekends, and the Sunrise Village Triple will spin until 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and 4:00 p.m. on weekends.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>A note for our snowboarders:</em> Thanks to our new cabins on the Skyeship Gondola, we're asking you to please utilize the snowboard racks outside of each cabin.

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Killington,</p><p>It was another unreal one at The Beast yesterday, with bright, clear skies setting the stage for buttery turns across the mountain. And we\u2019ve got more good news on the way. Snow moves in this afternoon, with flakes picking up after 2 p.m. under breezy east winds and temps topping out around 26 degrees at the summit and 29 degrees at the base. We\u2019re tracking 8 to 12 inches of fresh snow between this afternoon and Saturday night. Fresh turns are definitely on the menu!</p><p>We're still 100% open and are serving up the most expansive playground in the East. From top-to-bottom groomers to bump lines and hidden tree shots, it\u2019s all in play. Snow surfaces were gripping beautifully again, letting you link one deep turn after another as the sun and warmer temps kept the slopes soft, smooth, and playful. Groomed trails provide confidence inducing turns and are a blast to lean the edges into. Even as the day goes on, the smooth runs that turn into soft packed and packed powder continue to have a fun surface to rip on.&nbsp;</p><p>Our groomers went after the same program except they left Ovation on natural. Downdraft saw a resurface again and Superstar is still skiing &amp; riding really well. Make your way over to Needle\u2019s Eye on Cruise Control for a classic, cruise worthy run that never disappoints. For our full list of groomers, check out the <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire up later this week. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad and Canyon Quad opening soon after at 10:00 a.m. The Bear Mountain Quad will also spin again, offering full access to Outer Limits and Devil\u2019s Fiddle, amongst other favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\">kparks</a>, the lineup stays stacked. Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, and The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods.

Join us for our all-day party, first featuring a scavenger hunt for 20 YETI mugs hidden around the mountain. Find one to keep, and you\u2019ll score a 1-day lift ticket voucher, valid through June 1, 2027. We'll also be leading a party lap from the top of Superstar at 2:20 p.m., immediately followed by an apr\u00e8s scene at the bottom of Superstar featuring DJ Stevie B and $2.20 Michelob ULTRA, plus complimentary NA beverages and giveaways.</p><p>Finally, our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\">Tubing Park presented by bubly</a> remains open daily this week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.&nbsp;</p><p>Get fired up for a fun Friday!&nbsp;</p><p>\u2013 Evan</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Operating Day: 101&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><u>Lifts</u></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Key lifts operate seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, and from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday plus Peak Dates*; the Bear Mountain Quad will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every Saturday through the end of March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The North Ridge Quad will open at 9:30 a.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. on weekends, the Canyon Quad will spin from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekends, and the Sunrise Village Triple will spin until 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and 4:00 p.m. on weekends.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><em>A note for our snowboarders:</em> Thanks to our new cabins on the Skyeship Gondola, we're asking you to please utilize the snowboard racks outside of each cabin.

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Killington,</p><p>It was another unreal one at The Beast yesterday, with bright, clear skies setting the stage for buttery turns across the mountain. And we\u2019ve got more good news on the way. Snow moves in this afternoon, with flakes picking up after 2 p.m. under breezy east winds and temps topping out around 26 degrees at the summit and 29 degrees at the base. We\u2019re tracking 8 to 12 inches of fresh snow between this afternoon and Saturday night. Fresh turns are definitely on the menu!</p><p>We're still 100% open and are serving up the most expansive playground in the East. From top-to-bottom groomers to bump lines and hidden tree shots, it\u2019s all in play. Snow surfaces were gripping beautifully again, letting you link one deep turn after another as the sun and warmer temps kept the slopes soft, smooth, and playful. Groomed trails provide confidence inducing turns and are a blast to lean the edges into. Even as the day goes on, the smooth runs that turn into soft packed and packed powder continue to have a fun surface to rip on.&nbsp;</p><p>Our groomers went after the same program except they left Ovation on natural. Downdraft saw a resurface again and Superstar is still skiing &amp; riding really well. Make your way over to Needle\u2019s Eye on Cruise Control for a classic, cruise worthy run that never disappoints. For our full list of groomers, check out the <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire up later this week. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad and Canyon Quad opening soon after at 10:00 a.m. The Bear Mountain Quad will also spin again, offering full access to Outer Limits and Devil\u2019s Fiddle, amongst other favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\">kparks</a>, the lineup stays stacked. Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, and The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods. On Ramshead, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, 5 jumps, and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed in for fun progression options.</p><p>Today, we'll be hosting <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/events/events-calendar/200k-shred-day/\">200K Shred Day</a> to celebrate Killington hitting 200,000 followers on Instagram! Join us for our all-day party, first featuring a scavenger hunt for 20 YETI mugs hidden around the mountain. Find one to keep, and you\u2019ll score a 1-day lift ticket voucher, valid through June 1, 2027. We'll also be leading a party lap from the top of Superstar at 2:20 p.m., immediately followed by an apr\u00e8s scene at the bottom of Superstar featuring DJ Stevie B and $2.20 Michelob ULTRA, plus complimentary NA beverages and giveaways.</p><p>Finally, our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\">Tubing Park presented by bubly</a> remains open daily this week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.&nbsp;</p><p>Get fired up for a fun Friday!&nbsp;</p><p>\u2013 Evan</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Operating Day: 101&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><u>Lifts</u></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Key lifts operate seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, and from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday plus Peak Dates*; the Bear Mountain Quad will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every Saturday through the end of March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The North Ridge Quad will open at 9:30 a.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. on weekends, the Canyon Quad will spin from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekends, and the Sunrise Village Triple will spin until 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and 4:00 p.m. on weekends.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><em>A note for our snowboarders:</em> Thanks to our new cabins on the Skyeship Gondola, we're asking you to please utilize the snowboard racks outside of each cabin. If the racks are entirely full, please put your boards underneath the seats. This differs from our K-1 Gondola, where all snowboards should be brought inside the cabins.

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Killington,</p><p>It was another unreal one at The Beast yesterday, with bright, clear skies setting the stage for buttery turns across the mountain. And we\u2019ve got more good news on the way. Snow moves in this afternoon, with flakes picking up after 2 p.m. under breezy east winds and temps topping out around 26 degrees at the summit and 29 degrees at the base. We\u2019re tracking 8 to 12 inches of fresh snow between this afternoon and Saturday night. Fresh turns are definitely on the menu!</p><p>We're still 100% open and are serving up the most expansive playground in the East. From top-to-bottom groomers to bump lines and hidden tree shots, it\u2019s all in play. Snow surfaces were gripping beautifully again, letting you link one deep turn after another as the sun and warmer temps kept the slopes soft, smooth, and playful. Groomed trails provide confidence inducing turns and are a blast to lean the edges into. Even as the day goes on, the smooth runs that turn into soft packed and packed powder continue to have a fun surface to rip on.&nbsp;</p><p>Our groomers went after the same program except they left Ovation on natural. Downdraft saw a resurface again and Superstar is still skiing &amp; riding really well. Make your way over to Needle\u2019s Eye on Cruise Control for a classic, cruise worthy run that never disappoints. For our full list of groomers, check out the <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire up later this week. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad and Canyon Quad opening soon after at 10:00 a.m. The Bear Mountain Quad will also spin again, offering full access to Outer Limits and Devil\u2019s Fiddle, amongst other favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\">kparks</a>, the lineup stays stacked. Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, and The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods. On Ramshead, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, 5 jumps, and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed in for fun progression options.</p><p>Today, we'll be hosting <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/events/events-calendar/200k-shred-day/\">200K Shred Day</a> to celebrate Killington hitting 200,000 followers on Instagram!

    "report": "<p>Happy 100th day, Beast fans!</p><p>The conditions were absolutely beautiful yesterday, with soft snow that made it easy to dig your edges in and sunshine that added to the fun. We\u2019ll have more of those great surfaces waiting for you today, with 100% of our trails open and the most terrain offered in the East. We're also under a storm watch with 5 to 9 inches of new snow possible staring in the early afternoon tomorrow through Saturday.</p><p>Mostly sunny skies are on tap, with a high near 29\u00b0 at the base and 24\u00b0 at the peak. Light winds out of the northeast will shift southwest in the afternoon, keeping things comfortable as you chase the sun across The Beast.</p><p>Pretty much everything was fun to shred yesterday as the recent warmer temps softened up the snow and made for ideal surfaces to turn and slide on. Rime was the spot for silky smooth corduroy and everything at Bear Mountain has been shredding fantastically.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team worked through the night resurfacing over 80 trails. They threw Lower Downdraft and Middle Ovation on the plan which are both perfect runs for those chasing an adrenaline rush of carving. Superstar also has fresh corduroy and has been fun to ride. Head over to Bunny Buster for something more mellow that still has prime surfaces for arcing in the morning. Groomed surfaces will turn to equally enjoyable soft pack and packed powder as the day goes on. For our full list of groomers, check out the <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire back up later on this week. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad and Canyon Quad opening soon after at 10:00 a.m. The Bear Mountain Quad will also spin again, offering full access to Outer Limits and Devil\u2019s Fiddle, amongst other black diamond favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\">kparks</a>, the lineup stays stacked. Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, and The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods. On Ramshead, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, 5 jumps, and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed in for fun progression options.</p><p>Tomorrow, February 20th, we'll be hosting <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/events/events-calendar/200k-shred-day/\">200K Shred Day</a> to celebrate Killington hitting 200,000 followers on Instagram! Join us for our all-day party, first featuring a scavenger hunt for 20 YETI mugs hidden around the mountain. Find one to keep, and you\u2019ll score a 1-day lift ticket voucher, valid through June 1, 2027. We'll also be leading a party lap from the top of Superstar at 2:20 p.m., immediately followed by an apr\u00e8s scene at the bottom of Superstar featuring a live DJ and $2.20 Michelob ULTRA, plus complimentary NA beverages and giveaways.</p><p>Finally, our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\">Tubing Park presented by bubly</a> remains open daily this week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.&nbsp;</p><p>More great shredding and fun scenes await!&nbsp;</p><p>\u2013 Evan</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Operating Day: 100&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><u>Lifts</u></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Key lifts operate seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, and from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday plus Peak Dates*; the Bear Mountain Quad will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every Saturday through the end of March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The North Ridge Quad will open at 9:30 a.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. on weekends, the Canyon Quad will spin from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekends, and the Sunrise Village Triple will spin until 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and 4:00 p.m. on weekends.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><em>A note for our snowboarders:</em> Thanks to our new cabins on the Skyeship Gondola, we're asking you to please utilize the snowboard racks outside of each cabin.

    "report": "<p>Good evening, Beast fans, &nbsp;</p><p>The conditions were absolutely beautiful today, with soft snow that made it easy to dig your edges in and sunshine that added to the fun. We\u2019ll have more of those great surfaces waiting for you tomorrow, with 100% of our trails open and the most terrain offered in the East!</p><p>Mostly sunny skies are on tap tomorrow, with a high near 29\u00b0 at the base and 24\u00b0 at the peak. Light winds out of the northeast will shift southwest in the afternoon, keeping things comfortable as you chase the sun across The Beast.</p><p>Pretty much everything was fun to shred today as the recent warmer temps softened up the snow and made for ideal surfaces to turn and slide on. Rime was the spot for silky smooth corduroy and everything at Bear Mountain has been shredding fantastically.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team will be working through the night resurfacing over 80 trails. They threw Lower Downdraft and Middle Ovation on the plan which are both perfect runs for those chasing an adrenaline rush of carving. Superstar is also going to have fresh corduroy tomorrow and has been fun to ride. Head over to Bunny Buster for something more mellow that still has prime surfaces for arcing in the morning. Groomed surfaces will turn to equally enjoyable spring-like surfaces later in the day, and there\u2019s plenty of packed powder around the mountain. For our full list of groomers, check out the <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire back up later on this week.

Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, and The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods. On Ramshead, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, 5 jumps, and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed in for fun progression options.</p><p>On Friday, February 20th, we'll be hosting a <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/events/events-calendar/200k-shred-day/\">200K Shred Day</a> to celebrate Killington hitting 200,000 followers on Instagram!

    "report": "<p lang=\"EN-US\">Good morning, Beast fans!&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">It\u2019s felt downright balmy compared to recent memory, with temps creeping all the way up to 33\u00b0 yesterday. That just meant soft snow, gentle turns, and some nice, easy midweek laps. We\u2019re still offering up the most terrain in the East, so there are plenty of fun options to choose from today.</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Temps will stay in the mid 20s throughout the day, with winds staying calm throughout the morning and gusts at the peak only topping out around 25mph once the afternoon rolls around. There\u2019s also a chance at some more snow showers towards the tail of the day, with 1-3\" of accumulation possible.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">A highlight recently has been Upper Home Stretch, which offers a fun alternate route down to Skyeship base if you&nbsp;feel like straying from the safe confines of Great Eastern. Surfaces today won\u2019t be quite as soft as they were by the end of yesterday, so it should feel a bit more like winter than spring on the slopes. Areas at higher elevation that softened up may have a small crust in the morning, but temps aren\u2019t due to get low enough to seriously freeze anything up. Our groomers continued to do their thing last night, so if you\u2019re feeling hesitant about natural surfaces, check out our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\"><u>Lifts &amp; Trails Report</u></a> for the full list of groomed trails.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Speaking of, our grooming plan is offering many of the usual hits, with some extra attention being paid to smoothing out the entrances &amp; exits to adjacent trails along Superstar. We got winch cats out on Lower Pipe Dream to offer a groomed route to the South Ridge Quad, as well as on Lower Great Bear, which has tons of coverage after seeing a good amount of snowmaking.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire back up later on this week. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\"><u>Insider Blog</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad and Canyon Quad opening soon after at 10:00 a.m. The Bear Mountain Quad will also spin again, offering full access to Outer Limits and Devil\u2019s Fiddle, amongst other black diamond favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\"><u>kparks</u></a>, the lineup stays stacked.

    "report": "<p lang=\"EN-US\">Good evening, Beast fans!&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">It\u2019s felt downright balmy compared to recent memory, with temps creeping all the way up to 33\u00b0 earlier today. That just meant soft snow, gentle turns, and some nice, easy midweek laps. We\u2019re still offering up the most terrain in the East, so there are plenty of fun options to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Temps will drop just a bit this evening and stay in the mid 20s throughout tomorrow. Winds will pick up a little overnight and then calm down throughout the morning, with gusts at the peak only topping out around 25mph by the afternoon. There\u2019s also a chance at some more snow showers towards the tail of the day tomorrow, with 1-3\" of accumulation possible.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">A highlight of today was Upper Home Stretch, which offers a fun alternate route down to Skyeship base if you&nbsp;feel like straying from the safe confines of Great Eastern. Surfaces tomorrow won\u2019t be quite as soft as they were by the end of today, so it should feel a bit more like winter than spring on the slopes. Areas at higher elevation that softened up by the end of today may have a small crust in the morning, but temps aren\u2019t due to get low enough to seriously freeze anything up. Our groomers will continue to do their thing overnight, so if you\u2019re feeling hesitant tomorrow about natural surfaces, check out our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\"><u>Lifts &amp; Trails Report</u></a> for the full list of groomed trails.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Speaking of, our grooming plan is offering many of the usual hits tonight, with some extra attention being paid to smoothing out the entrances &amp; exits to adjacent trails along Superstar. We\u2019ll have winch cats out on Lower Pipe Dream to offer a groomed route to the South Ridge Quad tomorrow, as well as on Lower Great Bear, which has tons of coverage after seeing a good amount of snowmaking.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Snowmaking operations are still on hold for the time being due to warmer temps, but we could see the snowguns fire back up later on this week. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\"><u>Insider Blog</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin once again tomorrow at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad and Canyon Quad opening soon after at 10:00 a.m. The Bear Mountain Quad will also spin once again tomorrow, offering full access to Outer Limits and Devil\u2019s Fiddle, amongst other black diamond favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Over in <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/parks-report/\"><u>kparks</u></a>, the lineup stays stacked. Over towards Bear Mountain, Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, and The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus additional natural hits in the woods. On Ramshead, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features, 5 jumps, and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed in for fun progression options.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Finally, our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\"><u>Tubing Park presented by bubly</u></a> remains open daily this week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Same time again tomorrow?

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Beast fans!</p><p>It was a great end to the long weekend yesterday, and it looks like it's going to be another great day out there today. Comfortable temps, just a soft breeze, great visibility, and wall-to-wall terrain made for a fantastic President\u2019s Day on snow. We\u2019re rolling right through the holiday week with prime midwinter conditions across the most open terrain in the East.</p><p>Weather-wise, today will bring mostly cloudy skies with highs in the mid to upper 20s up top and low 30s at the base. Winds will be on the lighter side, generally 10\u201315 mph out of the west. There\u2019s a chance for light, showery precipitation during the day, mainly snow, with a brief mix possible at lower elevations. Nothing impactful, and the slightly warmer temps should help surfaces soften up nicely through the afternoon.</p><p>Snow surfaces remain in a really good place. Groomed terrain continues to offer that smooth, carve-friendly packed powder feel, with a few isolated slick spots here and there. With moderating temps, expect a little more give under your edges today while still holding onto that classic Beast bite.</p><p>Our grooming team is going with their usual plan, laying down cord across 89 trails, including Header, Wildfire, and Easy Street to name a few. Lower Double Dipper, Downdraft, and Lower Pipe Dream will come off the grooming plan, so those areas may start to bump up for anyone looking to mix in some natural terrain. Superstar has been added to the grooming lineup as crews begin flattening out the snowmaking whales while continuing to build toward spring. If you're looking to plan out your day, check out our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a> for all the latest.</p><p>Snowmaking operations are currently on hold with the warmer temperatures. If colder weather returns later this week, we could see guns fire back up. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about snowmaking and the natural challenges our crew has faced this winter, take a look at our most recent <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/the-mountain/sustainability-community/insider-blog/snowmaking-during-an-extended-cold-front/\">Insider Blog</a>.</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to spin once again today at 9:00 a.m., with the South Ridge Quad opening at 10:00 a.m. In addition to our regular Tuesday lineup, lifts like the Bear Mountain Quad, South Ridge Quad, and Canyon Quad will be running today, giving you even more terrain to explore.</p><p>Looking ahead, there are multiple additional chances for snow later this week and into the weekend, enough to keep things fresh as we move deeper into February.</p><p>Our <a href=\"https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/tubing-park/\">Tubing Park presented by bubly</a> remains open daily this week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p><p>Over in kparks, the lineup stays stacked. Dream Maker is firing with 21 features between the upper and lower sections, The Stash remains fully in play with its wooden and stone features plus natural hits in the woods, Timberline continues to shine with 45 features and a halfpipe, and Easy Street, Lil\u2019 Stash, and Vale Yard are all dialed on Ramshead.</p><p>Gonna feel a bit more like spring today. Enjoy the softer snow!</p><p>- Cullen</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Operating Day: 98</strong></p><p><strong><u>Lifts</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Key lifts operate seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, and from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday plus Peak Dates*; the Bear Mountain Quad will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every Saturday through the end of March.&nbsp;</p><p>The North Ridge Quad will open at 9:30 a.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. on weekends, the Canyon Quad will spin from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekends, and the Sunrise Village Triple will spin until 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and 4:00 p.m. on weekends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>A note for our snowboarders:</em> Thanks to our new cabins on the Skyeship Gondola, we're asking you to please utilize the snowboard racks outside of each cabin.
