    "report": "<p>Good morning, Pico fam!</p><p>What a beautiful President\u2019s Day it turned out to be. Comfortable temps, a soft breeze, and great visibility made for a fantastic day of turns across a 100% open hill. Today looks like much of the same!</p><p>If you're lucky enough to make it on the hill today, expect mostly cloudy skies with highs in the mid to upper 20s up top and low 30s at the base. Winds will be on the lighter side, generally 10\u201315 mph out of the west. There\u2019s a chance for light, showery precipitation during the day, mainly snow, with a slight mix possible at lower elevations. The moderating temps should help surfaces soften up nicely through the afternoon.</p><p>Snow surfaces are still fantastic all over the place. From LPT to Outpost and Knomes, there's something for everyone. Conditions are great on recently groomed Outpost runs like Bronco and Wrangler, while more compact runs like Poma Woods and Lift Line are still seeing plenty of coverage. Groomed terrain continues to deliver smooth turns, with a few isolated slick spots here and there at higher elevation. With the slightly warmer air, expect a little more give under your edges as the afternoon rolls around.</p><p>Our grooming team stuck with the same plan as the previous night, with the exception of removing C-Slope, Summit Glades, and Home Run between A-Slope and B-Slope. Be sure to check the <a href=\"https://www.picomountain.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a> in the morning for the full lineup before heading out.</p><p>Hopefully you know this by now if you're reading this, but it's still here\u2019s something we don\u2019t say often\u2026 we\u2019re open on a Tuesday!

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Pico family,</p><p>We\u2019re rolling into President\u2019s Day with classic midwinter conditions and a 100% open hill. A flurry or two is possible early this morning, but clouds will decrease through the day with some sun breaking out this afternoon.</p><p>Temperatures will feel comfortable for this time of year, especially compared to the deeper cold we saw earlier this month. Look for highs in the mid-20s up top and upper-20s at the base, with a light south breeze around 10\u201315 mph. Crisp, manageable, and perfect for a full day outside.</p><p>Snow surfaces remain in a really good place. Groomed terrain is delivering that smooth, carve-friendly packed powder feel by the afternoon, with a few isolated slick spots here and there. Expect fresh machine-groomed corduroy this morning, with the potential for a little softening later today as temps moderate and the sun works through.</p><p>Bronco continues to offer great turns for linking it all together, and the Poma Loop is skiing consistently top to bottom. Our grooming team resurfaced a strong lineup again last night, including Charlie\u2019s Highway, so there\u2019s no shortage of quality laps across the mountain.&nbsp;Be sure to check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.picomountain.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>&nbsp;for the full run down.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts begin spinning at 8:30 a.m. on the Golden Quad, Summit Quad, Little Pico Triple, and Bonanza Carpet, with the Outpost Double and Knomes Knoll Triple following at 9:00 a.m.</p><p>In the Pico Parks, Prospector into Panhandler remains the go-to progression zone. Prospector features a beginner-friendly jump line and smaller features, while Panhandler steps things up with trickier rails and bigger air. For a detailed look, check the Pico Parks Overview at the bottom of the Lifts &amp; Trails Report.</p><p>Looking ahead, we could see a light refresh of a couple of inches over the next few days, nothing major, but enough to keep things interesting as this strong stretch of winter continues.</p><p>And a reminder: we\u2019re open to the public every day through March 2, including bonus midweek action over the next two weeks. More days, more turns, more time to enjoy it all with family and friends.</p><p>Another beautiful winter day at Pico.

    "report": "<p>Good evening, Pico Family,&nbsp;</p><p>A picture-perfect bluebird day on the slopes was just what we ordered. This weekend has been filled with smiles, snowy high-fives, and plenty of great turns, and we\u2019re keeping the fun rolling right into Presidents Day! This is winter in its prime, and with all of our trails open, there\u2019s something for everyone to explore and enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Expect a mostly cloudy day on Washington\u2019s Birthday, with a slight chance of snow showers early tomorrow morning before things settle in. Temps will top out near 30\u00b0 at the base and 23\u00b0 near the top, with a steady south wind around 10\u201315 mph. It\u2019s classic Vermont conditions so get after it.</p><p>Even with the sunshine lighting up the mountain and comfortable temps keeping everyone smiling, our snow surfaces are holding strong. Thanks to the care and dedication of our mountain ops team, conditions remain consistent and enjoyable from top to bottom, so you can lean back and enjoy turns. Bronco is skiing wonderfully right now with surfaces that are perfect for linking up turns. Over on the Poma Loop, conditions are just as enjoyable, offering consistent coverage and a fun, flowing ride from start to finish. Our grooming team is after a sizable plan once again and added Charlie's Highway.

After 8\u201d of snow landed before Wednesday and Thursday, the clouds went away for a couple days of nice mountain views and even nicer mountain turns. We\u2019re just shy of 100% open, and conditions remain phenomenal all over.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Today\u2019s weather will be pretty mild, with temps topping out around 25\u00b0&nbsp;at the base and 18\u00b0 up top. Winds will stay calm around the base lodge and only top out around 25mph at the peak. Clouds will roll in, and we\u2019re hopefully going to see some more snowfall by day\u2019s end.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Groomed surfaces have been consistent and carve-able, and coverage is sure to still be great in the glades. Recent days have been filled with laps that you just don\u2019t want to end. Poma Woods is always a fun adventure, and Bronco is still delivering after getting a winch cat on it Thursday night.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Speaking of grooming, our team covered a lot last night, with over half of our trails getting some love. Lower Giant Killer and Birch Glades were smoothed out, and a lot of work was done flattening out A Slope after it saw plenty of snowmaking this past week.

    "report": "<p lang=\"EN-US\">Happy Valentine\u2019s Day (eve), Pico family!&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Things are lining up for another stellar Pico weekend. After 8\u201d of snow landed before Wednesday and Thursday, the clouds went away for a couple days of nice mountain views and even nicer mountain turns. We\u2019re still 100% open, and conditions remain phenomenal all over.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Tomorrow\u2019s weather will be pretty mild, with temps topping out around 25\u00b0&nbsp;at the base and 18\u00b0 up top. Winds will stay calm around the base lodge and only top out around 25mph at the peak. Clouds will roll in, and we\u2019re hopefully going to see some more snowfall by day\u2019s end.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Groomed surfaces have been consistent and carve-able, and coverage is sure to still be great in the glades. Recent days have been filled with laps that you just don\u2019t want to end. Poma Woods is always a fun adventure, and Bronco is still delivering after getting a winch cat on it Thursday night.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Speaking of grooming, our team is planning on covering a lot this evening, with over half of our trails due to get some love before lifts start spinning. Lower Giant Killer and Birch Glades will be smoothed out for the morning, and a lot of work will be done flattening out A Slope after it saw plenty of snowmaking this past week. For the full list of groomed trails, head to our <a href=\"https://www.picomountain.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\"><u>Lifts &amp; Trails Report</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">As a reminder, we\u2019ll have all 6 of our lifts running tomorrow, with the Bonanza Carpet, Golden Quad, Summit Quad, and Little Pico Triple scheduled to open at 8:30 a.m. and both the Outpost Double and Knomes Knoll Triple due to follow at 9:00 a.m.&nbsp;</p><p>Up in our Pico Parks, Prospector to Panhandler is still the route for progression and freestyle fun. Prospector bring a beginner jump line and smaller features, while Panhandler is the place to find some trickier rails and bigger air.
