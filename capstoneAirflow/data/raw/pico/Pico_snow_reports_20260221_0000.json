    "report": "<p>Good afternoon, Pico family,&nbsp;</p><p>It's hammering on the mountain! We've already received over three inches of fresh powder and the storm is just getting started, just in time for the weekend. We're expecting another 4-8\" inches of the fluffy stuff tonight, and another 1-2\" during the day on Saturday. Temps will be sitting comfortably in the low to mid 20s, falling slightly throughout the day. Get ready for good times and fresh tracks!</p><p>Conditions have been skiing and riding great, and they\u2019re only getting better. There will be lots of powder to be found across the mountain, and you\u2019ll be able to sink those edges deep on groomed terrain. As the day goes on, freshly groomed runs will transition from a smooth surface into soft packed powder, which will remain fun and forgiving. By the end of the day, there will be plenty of moguls to enjoy, especially on trails like Wrangler, Lift Line, and A Slope.</p><p>Our grooming team will be laying down the cord tonight through the storm, providing a solid package of groomers for the morning. Expressway, Triple Slope, and Fool\u2019s Gold are my go-to choices for cruiser laps. For a full list of groomed trails, head to our <a href=\"https://www.picomountain.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>.</p><p><em>Lift Status Update:&nbsp;</em><br><em>Our lift maintenance team has been working through the night to install the fabricated part for Summit Express. However, they encountered additional unexpected challenges and will need to continue work tomorrow morning, Feb 21, before we can re-open Summit Express Quad.&nbsp;</em></p><p lang=\"EN-US\"><em>Due to the increased business levels we expect at Killington Resort tomorrow, we will not be proactively calling the Summit Guarantee at this time. We will provide an update on the status of Summit Express by mid-morning. If a decision is&nbsp;made to activate the Summit Guarantee, depending on the outlook of Summit and capacity at Killington, we will communicate that at that time.&nbsp;</em></p><p lang=\"EN-US\"><em>Please note that the decision to implement the </em><a href=\"https://www.picomountain.com/the-mountain/mountain-info/summit-guarantee/\"><em><u>Summit Guarantee</u></em></a><em> is at the sole discretion of Killington Resort/Pico Mountain leadership team. This policy does not serve as a guarantee that it will be put into effect each time the Summit Express Quad is out of service.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The Outpost Double experienced a more significant mechanical failure on Wednesday, February 18, involving the lift\u2019s drive shaft. Outpost is a 1969 Carlevaro-Savio fixed-grip double chairlift. It is considered an \u201corphan lift,\u201d meaning the original manufacturer is no longer in operation. Because of this, replacement parts are extremely limited and must be specially sourced or custom fabricated. Due to the age of the lift and the complexity of sourcing components, the Outpost Double will be down for an extended period. There is currently no estimated timeline for its return to service.</em></p><p>We understand lift downtime impacts your experience, and we appreciate your patience as our mountain operations team works to resolve these issues.

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Pico family,&nbsp;</p><p>The conditions were a blast yesterday. Soft, edgeable snow made every turn feel smooth and confident, and the sunshine was the perfect finishing touch. We\u2019ll have more of those great surfaces waiting for you today, and with 100% of our trails open, there\u2019s plenty of terrain to explore from top to bottom.</p><p>Mostly sunny skies are on tap, with a high near 29\u00b0 at the base and 24\u00b0 at the peak. Light winds out of the northeast will shift southwest in the afternoon, keeping things comfortable as you chase the sun.</p><p>The recent warmer temps softened things up, creating ideal surfaces for smooth turns and easy sliding. Knomes Knoll is on fire right now, with a little bit of everything to keep things interesting. Whether you\u2019re looking to carve, cruise, or mix it up, there\u2019s plenty out there to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team got over 20 trails, leaving behind perfect corduroy. Head over to Fool\u2019s Gold for that early morning carving or to Triple Slope for a nice relaxing run.

    "report": "<p lang=\"EN-US\">Good morning, Pico family!&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">The sun dipped behind the clouds yesterday, but we got an additional inch of snow in the morning to make up for it. Temps stayed mild, the snow got softer, and it started to feel like spring for a bit out there. Today's feel should switch back towards winter, but nothing too crazy.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Temps will float in the mid 20s at our base, with peak temperatures settling in the lower 20s. Winds will pick up in the morning but settle down by the afternoon, and it shouldn\u2019t feel too cold out there overall. Some more snow is looking to roll in around the time lifts stop spinning, with hopefully 1-3\" waiting for us by the time Thursday morning comes around.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">The Summit Guarantee is in effect today as the Summit Quad remains under mechanical repair. The Knomes Knoll Triple will run in its place. If we are able to get that lift running later in the day, we will be sure to update you here. Please note that the Outpost Double is on hold due to a mechanical issue with no time estimate.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Snow surfaces will harden up a bit from yesterday, but nothing looks to become bulletproof overnight, as temps won\u2019t dip too far below freezing all day. Softer snow will likely pop up more at lower elevations, and groomed surfaces will continue to deliver the goods for anyone. On the grooming front, our crew stayed off of Lower Giant Killer, Stampede, and Charlie\u2019s Highway to protect coverage and keep things from not getting too firm. A Slope has been a lot of fun since receiving plenty of snowmaking coverage, and Triple Slope is always a classic option if you make it towards Knomes.

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Pico fam!</p><p>What a beautiful President\u2019s Day it turned out to be. Comfortable temps, a soft breeze, and great visibility made for a fantastic day of turns across a 100% open hill. Today looks like much of the same!</p><p>If you're lucky enough to make it on the hill today, expect mostly cloudy skies with highs in the mid to upper 20s up top and low 30s at the base. Winds will be on the lighter side, generally 10\u201315 mph out of the west. There\u2019s a chance for light, showery precipitation during the day, mainly snow, with a slight mix possible at lower elevations. We already had some light, fluffy stuff coming down this morning before lifts started spinning! The moderating temps should help surfaces soften up nicely through the afternoon.</p><p>Snow surfaces are still fantastic all over the place. From LPT to Outpost and Knomes, there's something for everyone. Conditions are great on recently groomed Outpost runs like Bronco and Wrangler, while more compact runs like Poma Woods and Lift Line are still seeing plenty of coverage. Groomed terrain continues to deliver smooth turns, with a few isolated slick spots here and there at higher elevation. With the slightly warmer air, expect a little more give under your edges as the afternoon rolls around.</p><p>Our grooming team stuck with much of their usual plan overnight, with trails like Ace of Clubs and Triple Slope getting a groom off of Knomes and each of the trails off of Golden getting some love. C-Slope, Summit Glades, and Home Run between A-Slope and B-Slope were not groomed to preserve snow cover, but there's still plenty of cover to be had for normal skiing &amp; riding.
