    "report": "<p lang=\"EN-US\">Good morning, Pico family!&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">The sun dipped behind the clouds yesterday, but we got an additional inch of snow in the morning to make up for it. Temps stayed mild, the snow got softer, and it started to feel like spring for a bit out there. Today's feel should switch back towards winter, but nothing too crazy.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Temps will float in the mid 20s at our base, with peak temperatures settling in the lower 20s. Winds will pick up in the morning but settle down by the afternoon, and it shouldn\u2019t feel too cold out there overall. Some more snow is looking to roll in around the time lifts stop spinning, with hopefully 1-3\" waiting for us by the time Thursday morning comes around.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">After our Summit Express Quad was down yesterday for mechanical repairs, we are hoping to have it running again at some point today, but we\u2019ll have further updates on that front. We appreciate your understanding and apologize for any inconvenience.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Snow surfaces will harden up a bit from yesterday, but nothing looks to become bulletproof overnight, as temps won\u2019t dip too far below freezing all day. Softer snow will likely pop up more at lower elevations, and groomed surfaces will continue to deliver the goods for anyone. On the grooming front, our crew stayed off of Lower Giant Killer, Stampede, and Charlie\u2019s Highway to protect coverage and keep things from not getting too firm. A Slope has been a lot of fun since receiving plenty of snowmaking coverage, and Triple Slope is always a classic option if you make it towards Knomes.

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Pico fam!</p><p>What a beautiful President\u2019s Day it turned out to be. Comfortable temps, a soft breeze, and great visibility made for a fantastic day of turns across a 100% open hill. Today looks like much of the same!</p><p>If you're lucky enough to make it on the hill today, expect mostly cloudy skies with highs in the mid to upper 20s up top and low 30s at the base. Winds will be on the lighter side, generally 10\u201315 mph out of the west. There\u2019s a chance for light, showery precipitation during the day, mainly snow, with a slight mix possible at lower elevations. We already had some light, fluffy stuff coming down this morning before lifts started spinning! The moderating temps should help surfaces soften up nicely through the afternoon.</p><p>Snow surfaces are still fantastic all over the place. From LPT to Outpost and Knomes, there's something for everyone. Conditions are great on recently groomed Outpost runs like Bronco and Wrangler, while more compact runs like Poma Woods and Lift Line are still seeing plenty of coverage. Groomed terrain continues to deliver smooth turns, with a few isolated slick spots here and there at higher elevation. With the slightly warmer air, expect a little more give under your edges as the afternoon rolls around.</p><p>Our grooming team stuck with much of their usual plan overnight, with trails like Ace of Clubs and Triple Slope getting a groom off of Knomes and each of the trails off of Golden getting some love. C-Slope, Summit Glades, and Home Run between A-Slope and B-Slope were not groomed to preserve snow cover, but there's still plenty of cover to be had for normal skiing &amp; riding. Be sure to check the <a href=\"https://www.picomountain.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a> for the full lineup before heading out.</p><p>Hopefully you know this by now if you're reading this, but it's still here\u2019s something we don\u2019t say often\u2026 we\u2019re open on a Tuesday! Bonus midweek action means prime opportunity for some Tuesday turns today.</p><p>The follow lifts will begin spinning at 9:00 a.m. today:</p><ul><li>Bonanza Carpet</li><li>Golden Express Quad</li><li>Little Pico Triple</li><li>Knomes Knoll Triple</li></ul><p>The Outpost Double will follow at 9:30 a.m. Please note, The Summit Express Quad will not operate today due to a mechanical issue. All Pico Season Passholders and Lift Tickets valid on Tuesday will be honored at Killington for no additional fee. Guests with valid Pico tickets and passes can proceed directly to the lifts at Killington. Thank you for your understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, we\u2019re keeping an eye on multiple chances for snow later this week and into the weekend, enough to keep things fresh as we roll through this strong stretch of winter.</p><p>Hope to see you out there today!</p><p>- Cullen</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Period of 7 days/week lift operations: February 16th - March 2nd.</em></p><p>Key lifts operate Monday, Thursday, &amp; Friday from 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. On Saturday &amp; Sunday, key lifts operate from 8:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.</p><p><strong>Uphill Travel&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>Pico Base to the top of Golden Express Quad - <strong>Open</strong></li><li>Pico Base to Pico Summit - <strong>Open</strong></li><li>Summit Glade Route - <strong>Open</strong></li><li>Killington/Pico Mountain Interconnect \u2013 <strong>Open</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul><p>All uphill travelers are required to have an Uphill Travel Pass and armband, which can be picked up at any ticket window.

With the slightly warmer air, expect a little more give under your edges as the afternoon rolls around.</p><p>Our grooming team stuck with much of their usual plan overnight, with trails like Ace of Clubs and Triple Slope getting a groom off of Knomes and each of the trails off of Golden getting some love. C-Slope, Summit Glades, and Home Run between A-Slope and B-Slope were not groomed to preserve snow cover, but there's still plenty of cover to be had for normal skiing &amp; riding. Be sure to check the <a href=\"https://www.picomountain.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a> for the full lineup before heading out.</p><p>Hopefully you know this by now if you're reading this, but it's still here\u2019s something we don\u2019t say often\u2026 we\u2019re open on a Tuesday! Bonus midweek action means prime opportunity for some Tuesday turns today.</p><p>The follow lifts will begin spinning at 9:00 a.m. today:</p><ul><li>Bonanza Carpet</li><li>Golden Express Quad</li><li>Little Pico Triple</li><li>Knomes Knoll Triple</li></ul><p>The Outpost Double will follow at 9:30 a.m. Please note, The Summit Express Quad will not operate today due to a mechanical issue. All Pico Season Passholders and Lift Tickets valid on Tuesday will be honored at Killington for no additional fee. Guests with valid Pico tickets and passes can proceed directly to the lifts at Killington. Thank you for your understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, we\u2019re keeping an eye on multiple chances for snow later this week and into the weekend, enough to keep things fresh as we roll through this strong stretch of winter.</p><p>Hope to see you out there today!</p><p>- Cullen</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Period of 7 days/week lift operations: February 16th - March 2nd.</em></p><p>Key lifts operate Monday, Thursday, &amp; Friday from 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. On Saturday &amp; Sunday, key lifts operate from 8:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.</p><p><strong>Uphill Travel&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>Pico Base to the top of Golden Express Quad - <strong>Open</strong></li><li>Pico Base to Pico Summit - <strong>Open</strong></li><li>Summit Glade Route - <strong>Open</strong></li><li>Killington/Pico Mountain Interconnect \u2013 <strong>Open</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul><p>All uphill travelers are required to have an Uphill Travel Pass and armband, which can be picked up at any ticket window.

    "report": "<p>Good afternoon, Pico family,</p><p>What a beautiful President\u2019s Day it turned out to be. Comfortable temps, a soft breeze, and great visibility made for a fantastic day of turns across a 100% open hill. If you made it out today, you were rewarded.</p><p>We\u2019ll carry that momentum right into tomorrow with another solid midwinter day on tap. Expect mostly cloudy skies with highs in the mid to upper 20s up top and low 30s at the base. Winds will be on the lighter side, generally 10\u201315 mph out of the west. There\u2019s a chance for light, showery precipitation during the day, mainly snow, with a brief mix possible at lower elevations. In fact, the moderating temps should help surfaces soften up nicely through the afternoon.</p><p>Snow surfaces remain in a really good place. Groomed terrain continues to deliver that smooth, carve-friendly packed powder feel, with a few isolated slick spots here and there. With the slightly warmer air, expect a little more give under your edges while still holding onto that classic Pico consistency.</p><p>Our grooming team is sticking with the same plan as last night, with the exception of removing C-Slope, Summit Glades, and Homerun between A-Slope and B-Slope.

    "report": "<p>Good morning, Pico family,</p><p>We\u2019re rolling into President\u2019s Day with classic midwinter conditions and a 100% open hill. A flurry or two is possible early this morning, but clouds will decrease through the day with some sun breaking out this afternoon.</p><p>Temperatures will feel comfortable for this time of year, especially compared to the deeper cold we saw earlier this month. Look for highs in the mid-20s up top and upper-20s at the base, with a light south breeze around 10\u201315 mph. Crisp, manageable, and perfect for a full day outside.</p><p>Snow surfaces remain in a really good place. Groomed terrain is delivering that smooth, carve-friendly packed powder feel by the afternoon, with a few isolated slick spots here and there. Expect fresh machine-groomed corduroy this morning, with the potential for a little softening later today as temps moderate and the sun works through.</p><p>Bronco continues to offer great turns for linking it all together, and the Poma Loop is skiing consistently top to bottom. Our grooming team resurfaced a strong lineup again last night, including Charlie\u2019s Highway, so there\u2019s no shortage of quality laps across the mountain.&nbsp;Be sure to check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.picomountain.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a>&nbsp;for the full run down.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts begin spinning at 8:30 a.m. on the Golden Quad, Summit Quad, Little Pico Triple, and Bonanza Carpet, with the Outpost Double and Knomes Knoll Triple following at 9:00 a.m.</p><p>In the Pico Parks, Prospector into Panhandler remains the go-to progression zone. Prospector features a beginner-friendly jump line and smaller features, while Panhandler steps things up with trickier rails and bigger air. For a detailed look, check the Pico Parks Overview at the bottom of the Lifts &amp; Trails Report.</p><p>Looking ahead, we could see a light refresh of a couple of inches over the next few days, nothing major, but enough to keep things interesting as this strong stretch of winter continues.</p><p>And a reminder: we\u2019re open to the public every day through March 2, including bonus midweek action over the next two weeks. More days, more turns, more time to enjoy it all with family and friends.</p><p>Another beautiful winter day at Pico.

    "report": "<p>Good evening, Pico Family,&nbsp;</p><p>A picture-perfect bluebird day on the slopes was just what we ordered. This weekend has been filled with smiles, snowy high-fives, and plenty of great turns, and we\u2019re keeping the fun rolling right into Presidents Day! This is winter in its prime, and with all of our trails open, there\u2019s something for everyone to explore and enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Expect a mostly cloudy day on Washington\u2019s Birthday, with a slight chance of snow showers early tomorrow morning before things settle in. Temps will top out near 30\u00b0 at the base and 23\u00b0 near the top, with a steady south wind around 10\u201315 mph. It\u2019s classic Vermont conditions so get after it.</p><p>Even with the sunshine lighting up the mountain and comfortable temps keeping everyone smiling, our snow surfaces are holding strong. Thanks to the care and dedication of our mountain ops team, conditions remain consistent and enjoyable from top to bottom, so you can lean back and enjoy turns. Bronco is skiing wonderfully right now with surfaces that are perfect for linking up turns. Over on the Poma Loop, conditions are just as enjoyable, offering consistent coverage and a fun, flowing ride from start to finish. Our grooming team is after a sizable plan once again and added Charlie's Highway. Be sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.picomountain.com/the-mountain/conditions-weather/lifts-trails-report/\">Lifts &amp; Trails Report</a> for the full run down.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder, the Golden Quad, Summit Quad, Little Pico Triple, and Bonanza Carpet are scheduled to open at 9:00 a.m. with the Outpost Double and Knomes Knoll Triple due to follow at 9:30 a.m.&nbsp;</p><p>Up in our Pico Parks, Prospector to Panhandler is still the route for progression and freestyle fun. Prospector bring a beginner jump line and smaller features, while Panhandler is the place to find some trickier rails and bigger air.

After 8\u201d of snow landed before Wednesday and Thursday, the clouds went away for a couple days of nice mountain views and even nicer mountain turns. We\u2019re just shy of 100% open, and conditions remain phenomenal all over.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Today\u2019s weather will be pretty mild, with temps topping out around 25\u00b0&nbsp;at the base and 18\u00b0 up top. Winds will stay calm around the base lodge and only top out around 25mph at the peak. Clouds will roll in, and we\u2019re hopefully going to see some more snowfall by day\u2019s end.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Groomed surfaces have been consistent and carve-able, and coverage is sure to still be great in the glades. Recent days have been filled with laps that you just don\u2019t want to end. Poma Woods is always a fun adventure, and Bronco is still delivering after getting a winch cat on it Thursday night.&nbsp;</p><p lang=\"EN-US\">Speaking of grooming, our team covered a lot last night, with over half of our trails getting some love. Lower Giant Killer and Birch Glades were smoothed out, and a lot of work was done flattening out A Slope after it saw plenty of snowmaking this past week.
